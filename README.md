# 🩺 Health Trend & Early Warning Analytics Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing health-related data over time—such as heart rate, physical activity, sleep patterns, and lifestyle habits—to identify early warning trends that may indicate potential health risks.

Instead of diagnosing diseases, the system monitors changes and deviations from a person’s normal health patterns. For example, if someone’s resting heart rate is gradually increasing over several days while their sleep and activity are decreasing, the system highlights this as a risk trend.

The platform also analyzes how lifestyle factors—like sleep duration, physical activity, and stress—impact health metrics. These relationships are visualized so users can understand what behaviors may be influencing their health trends.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 📈 *Health Trend Monitoring* – Tracks vital metrics over time  
- ⚠️ *Risk Trajectory Visualization* – Shows how risk evolves  
- 🔗 *Lifestyle vs Health Correlation* – Connects habits with health outcomes  
- 🚨 *Early Warning Alerts* – Flags abnormal patterns  

---

## 🐳 System Architecture (Docker-Based)

The entire system is built using Docker, where different services operate independently:

- *Data Ingestion Service* – Collects and preprocesses health data  
- *Analytics Engine* – Processes trends and detects anomalies  
- *Alert Generation Service* – Generates early warnings based on rules  

These services communicate with a central database and are containerized using Docker for scalability and portability.

## 📊 Power BI Visualization

The processed insights are visualized using Power BI dashboards, including:

- Time-series health trends  
- Risk progression over time  
- Lifestyle vs health correlation charts  
- Early warning alert summaries  

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is *preventive analytics*—helping users recognize unhealthy trends early so they can take timely lifestyle actions.

## 🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with real wearable APIs  
- Real-time data streaming  
- Personalized health recommendations  
- Mobile dashboard support
